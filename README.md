# Loan_Approval-Classification 

On this project we tried to predict if the request of a person for a loan will be approved or not. First, i performed data preprocessing on the dataset (handling missing values,checking for outliers), for example we detect that the range of the values regarding the age of the people were [0,144], so i had to handle this outliers. Next i transformed the categorical features to numerical using the methods (label encoding & one-hot encoding), this create a new data frame with more features than the initial but all features were numeric type. After that i applied the normalization method so all features to have the same range of values between [0,1]. After the data preprocessing i check the correlation between the different features and the target class. The data were ready to apply machine learning algorithms. I split the data to train and test set.
First i applied the LogisticRegresion algorithm, with default values on the parameters and the accuracy of the algorithm was 90%. I tried to imporove the accuracy of the model using the method of GridSearch, in order to find the best values for the parameters of the algorithm, but it had also the same result accuracy 90%.
Second algorithm that i applied was the XG-Boost, this algorithm had higher accuracy equal to 94% !!!.
Finally, i create a neural network with 2 hidden layers and performed 92% accuracy, i applied the method of the EarlyStopping to prevent my model from overfitting. I tried several methods to improve the performance of the model by adding more layers, more filters on the layers but all methods had the same results.
Note: I applied the PCA method, to reduce the dimensions of the features, by setting a threshold 95%, this resulted to reduce the number of the features, but when i applied the above algorthms, all had lower accuracy.
